During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission — the one we were waiting for since last autumn, but the updates were confusing as it did not include the full feedback from reviewer or maybe editor.Anyway, I believe the team, although there was a bit of delay and less communication at recent days, they really tried best for paper and cooperation.We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link finally came last week, I think.Also, please remind me, if the doctor still plans for the acknowledgments section edit before he sends again.Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so.Overall, let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets.
