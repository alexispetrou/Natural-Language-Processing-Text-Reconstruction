    "Για την ανάλυση και επεξεργασία φυσικής γλώσσας, μπορούμε εναλλακτικά να χρησιμοποιήσουμε τη βιβλιοθήκη TextBlob, η οποία προσφέρει ένα πιο φιλικό και απλοποιημένο περιβάλλον σε σχέση με το NLTK. Το TextBlob περιλαμβάνει ενσωματωμένο tokenizer και POS tagger, ενώ παρέχει και πρόσθετα εργαλεία όπως διόρθωση ορθογραφίας, ανάλυση συναισθήματος και μετάφραση.\n",
